# Sigfides Tools Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Structural Diagnostics

Tools focused on discovering and validating structural truth before growth.

- [ ] Robots.txt Diagnostics  
  Crawl governance across Google, Bing, Applebot, AI search systems and LLM indexers.

- [ ] Sitemap Architecture Scanner  
  Declared structure, discoverability and systems-level content visibility.

- [ ] Page Structure & Canonical Check  
  Titles, canonical relationships, robots state and page-level integrity.

- [ ] GBP ID Finder  
  Business identity, location authority and Google Business Profile integrity.

---

## Phase 2 — Schema Builder (Planned)

A blueprint-based schema builder that generates JSON-LD **only after**
identity, crawl and structure have been validated.

This is **not** a generic schema generator.

Principles:
- Schema declares verified truth — it does not invent it
- Inputs are derived from GBP, NAP and site diagnostics
- Guardrails prevent schema spam or over-declaration

Purpose:
Translate validated business reality into machine-readable structure
for search engines, AI systems and entity graphs.
