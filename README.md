# Sigfides Tools

Sigfides Tools is a diagnostics and blueprint toolkit focused on
NAP consistency, Google Business Profile (GBP) integrity, schema alignment,
crawl governance and systems-level visibility.

Sigfides is **not a marketing tool**.

It is the **technical blueprint layer** businesses rely on to establish
structural trust, identity coherence and crawl clarity **before**
scaling marketing and sales initiatives.

## 🎯 Purpose

Modern search and AI systems depend on **structural correctness**, not tactics.

Sigfides exists to ensure a business is:

- correctly identified (NAP + GBP)
- geographically anchored
- crawl-accessible across search & AI ecosystems
- structurally coherent at page and site level
- ready for machine-readable declaration (schema)

This foundation allows future growth efforts to compound instead of collapse.

## 🧰 Phase 1 — Structural Diagnostics (Current)

Phase 1 tools focus on **discovering and validating truth**.

These diagnostics establish whether a business is structurally ready
to be interpreted correctly by search engines, AI systems and entity graphs.

### Current & Planned Phase 1 Tools

- **GBP ID Finder**  
  Alignment of business identity, location authority and profile integrity
  for structured visibility and trust signals.

- **Robots.txt Diagnostics**  
  Crawl governance and safety — ensuring Google, Bing, Applebot,
  AI search systems and LLM indexers can access the correct sections
  without accidental suppression or leakage.

- **Sitemap Architecture Scanner**  
  Declared structure, discoverability and systems-level content visibility
  across pages and site entities.

- **Page Structure & Canonical Check**  
  Page-level structural signals — titles, canonical relationships,
  robots state and content surface strength.

**Outcome of Phase 1:**
Verified identity, crawl access, structural clarity and index eligibility.

## 🧱 Phase 2 — Schema Builder (Planned)

Phase 2 introduces the **Sigfides Schema Builder**.

This is **not a generic schema generator**.

Schema in Sigfides is only generated **after diagnostics validate reality**.

### Phase 2 Principles

- Schema declares verified truth — it does not invent it
- Inputs are derived from GBP, NAP, site structure and diagnostics
- Guardrails prevent schema spam or over-declaration

### Planned Outputs

- Organization & LocalBusiness schema
- GBP-aligned services and areas served
- Website, WebPage and Breadcrumb structures
- Validation of mismatches before deployment

**Purpose:**
Translate validated business reality into machine-readable structure
for search engines, AI systems and entity graphs.

## 📍 Project Status

Sigfides Tools is under active development.

Phase 1 diagnostics establish the foundation.  
Phase 2 schema formalises that foundation.
